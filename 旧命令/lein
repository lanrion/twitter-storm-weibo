类似于maven的打包工具，可不用理之。
lein deps  下载project.clj需要依赖的jar包
lein compile 编译

安装：
Leiningen is a simple build tool for Clojure, based on Maven (I’m pretty sure). It offers a simple, Clojuresque way of constructing build files for your Clojure projects (which run on the JVM).
To install Leiningen you only have to download one file and put it in some directory that’s on your PATH:
cd ~/bin
wget http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/stable/bin/lein
chmod +x lein
You then do a self-install:
lein self-install
This will dowload a number of jar files, including Clojure itself, so you do not even have to have Clojure installed at this point.

lein uberjar
